- [Everything I know about blogging](https://ferrucc.io/posts/starting-a-blog/): 
  - No one has time to read your article, write the first lines like they’re a TLDR.
  - The design of your site is irrelevant.
  - To start out you don’t need any software.
  - Define your audience.
  - Figure out where your audience is.
  - For SEO don’t write short articles (>2000 words)
  - One well researched article is better than a lot of mediocre content
  - Spend half of the time writing, half promoting.
  - Spend 50% of the writing time actually writing, the rest tweaking, reading and illustrating. Details are important.
  - Spill all your secrets. Don’t be worried about the fact that you’ll run out of content, you won’t.
  - There are no rules, slowly craft your unique style.
  - Go back in your old posts and link them to newer ones.
  - Start a Newsletter.
  - Do what everyone else is afraid to do.
  - Reach out to people asking for things or offering tips.
